# Antarctic_volcano_comparison_manuscript
Code and data for replicating the analyses in the Noell et al. Antarctic volcano comparison manuscript

All code is written in R and is given in the .Rmd files, with the associated Figure number given in the name of the .Rmd file. Necessary files for doing these analyses are provided as well, except for the 16S rRNA gene sequence files (available on NCBI) and metagenome files (also available on NCBI), as well as the large files required for the metagenome marker gene analysis (Figure 3C). For the latter, contact Stephen Noell stephen.noell@waikato.ac.nz for access to the raw data.
